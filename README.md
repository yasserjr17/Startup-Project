# Startup Profit Prediction using Regression Models

This project focuses on predicting the profit of startups based on various financial and operational features. The dataset includes variables such as R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State. 

Key components of the project:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Heatmaps and correlation analysis to understand relationships between features.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling categorical variables and feature scaling.
- **Modeling Techniques:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
  - Accuracy (if classification threshold is used)
- **Visualization:** Graphs showing regression fits, error analysis, and feature importance

The goal is to build a robust regression model that helps investors or startup owners predict their potential profit based on input spending strategies.

Dataset: 50_Startups.csv (commonly used for regression problems)
